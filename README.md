# HaromSzogek

This project was a school assignment. It's purpose is to determine if a triangle can be formed with the given lengths, read from a file.

## Description

When you start the program a window will show up. You'll have to click on the 'Adatok betöltése' button and then select the file you want to load in. There's a given, default file for this called 'haromszog.txt'.

After that the datas will be shown. There are multiple parts of the window: 'Hibák a kiválasztott állományban', 'Derékszögű háromszögek', 'Kiválasztott derékszögű háromszög adatai'.

The first one will tell you which line is problematic from the given parametars, and what is the problem e.g.: The numbers are not in order, or that the triangle is right triangle etc.
